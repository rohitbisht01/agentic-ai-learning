1. Generative AI vs Agentic AI
    - genrative ai : class of ai models that can create new content - text, images, videos, audio or code, just like created by human
    - examples of generative ai are llm based apps like chatgpt, diffusion models for images, code generation llms like codellama, tts model like elevenlabs,
    video generation model like sora
     
    - comparision between generative ai vs traditional ai
    - traditional ai is about finding patterns in data and giving predictions like classification problem(checking email is spam or not)
    - generative ai is about learning the distribution of data so that i can generate a new sample from it.

    - application areas: generating text like human, software development, customer support, education, designing, etc

    - generative ai is about creating content, agentic ai is about solving a goal

2. Agentic AI
    - type of ai that takes up a task from a user and work towards completing it on its own, with
     minimal human guidance. it plans, take actions, adapt to changes, and seek help only when necessary

    - key characteristics
    
    - autonomous: ability to make decision on its own to achieve a given goal, without needing step-to-step human interaction. autonomy in multiple facets, execution, decision making and tool usage.

    autonomy can be controlled, like permission scoping, human interaction, override controls, policies(defining hard rules and boundaries). autonomy can be dangerous

    - goal oriented: goals can come with contraints, goals are stored in core memory, we can change the goal midway

    - planning: agents ability to break down a goal into structured sequence of actions or subgoals and decide the best path to achieve the desired outcome.

    - reasoning: cognitive process through which an agentic ai system interprets information, 
    draws conclusion and make decisions- both while planning ahead and while executing actions in real time.

    - adaptibility: ability of an agent to modify its plan, strategies or action in response to unexpected conditions, all while staying aligned with the goal.

    - context awareness: agent;s ability to understand, retain and utilize relevant information from the ongoing task, past interactions, user preferences to make better decisions throughout a multi-step process.
    
    types of context: context awareness implemented through memory, short term memory and long term memory 

    - core high level components of an agentic ai
    1. brain (mainly llm), it does goal interpretation, planning, reasoning, tool selection, communication b/w human and agent
    2. orhestrator: (executes the plan), task sequencing, conditional routing, retry logic, looping and iteration, delegation
    3. tools: external actions, knowledge base access
    4. memory: short-term memory, long-term memory, state tracking
    5. supervisor: (helps in communicating with agent with human), approval requests(agent checks with human before high-risk actions), guardrails enforcement, edge case escalation

3. LangGraph, why it exists, diff between langchain and langgraph (when to use what)
    - what is langchain
    1. open sourcee library which simplifies the process of building llm based apps.
    2. it consists of multiple components: model, prompts and retrievers, chains(biggest offering of langchain)
    3. what can we do with langchain: chatbots,text summarizer, multi-step workflows, RAG apps, basic level agents
